# Tenets - Unless you now better ones

## Security

Security is job zero for us and key for enterprise customers to be compliant with company regularities. A high security bar and transparency of what is implemented on every level is important to earn and maintain customer trust.

## Simplicity

Cloud adoption acceleration is key for future success of enterprise customers on AWS. We enable our enterprise customers to build strong ownership on cloud foundations AWS ProServe, a Partner and customer are building together. Simplicity of a solution ensures customer can understand at all levels for later maintainability and operational excellence. 

## Transparency & Flexibility

A cloud foundation deployment and account baseline provisioning is a complex process. In any point in time there will be a failure as with any IT system. Customer wants to understand every detail of the foundation in order to find issues and improve or enhance the solution with time.

## Scalability

Future growth is for-seen for most enterprise customers of certain size. Hence, AWS Organziations with around 500 accounts is common in this field. Future changes and upgrades fit into the scaling approach.

# How Enterprise Jumpstart serves our tenets

## Security

Enterprise jumpstart ensures access control follows the least privilege model. Central logging and auditing is enabled by default using AWS Cloudtrail and AWS Config. Organization wide enforcement of data collecting from those services is done via AWS Organizations. A dedicated deployment account ensures the organization management account can be locked down as much as possible. Encryption at rest is enabled for all assets stored on AWS using customer managed KMS keys.

## Simplicity

Enterprise Jumpstart makes use of AWS Organizations features whenever possible and use only well documented AWS native APIs in order to reduce implementation efforts. Hence, enterprise jumpstart is set up in a modular way to give customer the option to understand one module isolated from the whole picture.

## Transparency & Flexibility

Every creation or update of resources can be observed either in AWS Cloudformation event logs or AWS Cloudwatch logs. This way a customer can find issues within deployment and account provisioning fast and further improve the related component. Enterprise jumpstart enables customers to understand troubleshoot processes in an easy way. Next to transparency, flexibility goes hand in hand. Enterprise customers have very specific fixed requirements on their cloud foundation. Enterprise jumpstart is prescriptive in his core but does not intend to be a full blown solution covering all topic within a cloud foundation.


## Scalability

Enterprise Jumpstart takes apart the central configuration from deployment and baseli of individual accounts. This way future changes and upgrades to account can be performed in stages to test configurations and batches on organizational unit level.
